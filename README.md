# SwiftLed

Lighting controller implementation in swift. Completely unsupported and
experimental.

Designed to interface with github.com/mikelikespie/go-led-spi specifically, but
also should work with arbitrary OLP servers.

Mostly putting code here to share, but if somebody else wants to use it, I'll
gladly license it under MIT or Apache 2.

## Sources/OPC

OPC library. Similar to openpixelcontrol's OPC library... but in Swift.

## Sources/swiftled

Test executable is here. Will probably do more visualizations in the future.

##  SwiftledMobile

UI that uses OPC library. Probably will have code specific to my LED ball. Fork
it. Do what you want.
